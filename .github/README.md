# Swole CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automated deployment pipeline using your `apollo-runners` self-hosted GitHub Actions runner.

## Workflows

### üèóÔ∏è Backend Deployment (`deploy-backend.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch with changes in `swoleBackend/`
- Pull request to `main` with backend changes
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Builds Docker image with commit SHA tag
2. ‚úÖ Deploys to Kubernetes cluster on your home server
3. ‚úÖ Waits for pods to be ready
4. ‚úÖ Runs database seeding job
5. ‚úÖ Tests health endpoint
6. ‚úÖ Cleans up old Docker images
7. ‚úÖ Provides deployment info (NodePort access)

### üì± Frontend Build (`deploy-frontend.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch with changes in `swoleMobile/`
- Pull request to `main` with frontend changes  
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Installs Node.js dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Runs linting and type checking
3. ‚úÖ Builds React Native app
4. ‚úÖ Updates API configuration with K8s endpoint
5. ‚úÖ Tests backend connectivity

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Apollo Runners Configuration
Your `apollo-runners` self-hosted runner needs:
- ‚úÖ Docker installed and accessible
- ‚úÖ `kubectl` configured to access your K8s cluster
- ‚úÖ Node.js 20+ for frontend builds
- ‚úÖ Network access to your Kubernetes cluster

### 2. Runner Permissions
The runner needs these capabilities:
```bash
# Docker operations
docker build, docker tag, docker rmi

# Kubernetes operations  
kubectl apply, kubectl get, kubectl wait, kubectl delete

# Node.js operations
npm ci, npm run build, npm run lint
```

### 3. Repository Setup
No secrets needed! Everything runs locally on your server.

```

## Monitoring

### Deployment Status
Check workflow status at:
```
https://github.com/matthewmyrick/swole/actions
```

### API Health
After deployment, check:
```bash
# Get the API endpoint
kubectl get svc swole-api-service -n swole

# Test health
curl http://YOUR-NODE-IP:30080/health
```

### Logs
View logs directly:
```bash
# API logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/swole-api -n swole

# Database logs  
kubectl logs -f statefulset/postgres -n swole

# Recent deployments
kubectl get pods -n swole
```

## Manual Operations

### Force Redeploy
```bash
# Trigger manual deployment
gh workflow run deploy-backend.yml

# Or use GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Deploy Swole Backend ‚Üí Run workflow
```

### Rollback
```bash
# Check deployment history
kubectl rollout history deployment/swole-api -n swole

# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/swole-api -n swole
```

### Clean Restart
```bash
# Restart API pods
kubectl rollout restart deployment/swole-api -n swole

# Restart PostgreSQL (careful!)
kubectl delete pod postgres-0 -n swole
```

## Troubleshooting

### Runner Issues
```bash
# Check runner status
sudo systemctl status actions.runner.apollo-runners

# Restart runner
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.apollo-runners
```

### Build Failures
Common issues:
- **Docker build fails**: Check Dockerfile.api and dependencies
- **K8s apply fails**: Check kubectl connectivity and permissions  
- **Health check fails**: Check if pods are running and NodePort is accessible
- **Seed job fails**: Check PostgreSQL is ready and database schema

### Network Issues
```bash
# Test from runner to K8s
kubectl cluster-info

# Test NodePort access
curl http://localhost:30080/health
```

## Security

### What's Secure
‚úÖ No secrets in GitHub - everything runs locally  
‚úÖ Self-hosted runner on your network  
‚úÖ Direct K8s cluster access (no external exposure)  
‚úÖ Docker images stay local  

### Considerations
‚ö†Ô∏è Runner has full K8s cluster access  
‚ö†Ô∏è Basic database auth (fine for home lab)  
‚ö†Ô∏è No image registry - images stored locally  

Perfect for your home server setup! üè†
